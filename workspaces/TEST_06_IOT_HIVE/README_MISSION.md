# 🧪 TEST_06 : IOT HIVE - MISSION PROTOCOL

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE (HYPOTHESIS)
**Hypothesis**: A stateless AI agent operating over 50+ complex interactions will maintain 100% architectural integrity if, and only if, its state is reconstructed from an immutable DNA source at each session reset.

## 🔬 WHAT IS BEING TESTED?
1.  **Drift Resistance**: Can the AI manage 1000 sensors without hallucinating new protocols after 20 manual changes?
2.  **Re-anchoring Efficiency**: Does the AI recover its full governance rules after a complete history wipe?
3.  **Immunity to Carryover**: Proof that no "hidden memory" or biased patterns from previous sessions contaminate the new "clean" rehydration.

## 🧬 WORKFLOW
- **Step 1**: Re-anchoring from the Master Exemplaire (v2.5).
- **Step 2**: Intent-to-DNA Transcription (Genesis Lab).
- **Step 3**: Structural Injection (Photocopy).
- **Step 4**: Stress-Interaction Chain (20+ cycles).

## 🏆 EXPECTED OUTCOME
The project `TEST_06_IOT_HIVE` must remain 100% compliant with the `Schema_Genome_Core.json` created at T=0, regardless of the chaotic interaction history.
