# 🧠 COGNITIVE TASK REGISTRY (The Growth Codons)
> **Role**: Active Task Management & Neural Planning
> **Purpose**: Managing the current "Active Growth" of the project organism.

In the G-Genome framework, every task is a **Codon** (Intention, Action, Validation).

## 🚀 Active Growth (Current Codons)

### [CODON-001] Mission : Master Kit Validation
- **Intention**: Perform a "Blank Test" of the G-Genome Bootstrap Protocol to verify the integration of DNA + Substrate.
- **Action**: Prepare a dummy specification in `CONTEXT_SUBSTRATE` and trigger the `G-GENOME_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL`.
- **Validation**: AI generates an initialization report that accurately synthesizes both universal laws and mock specifications.

## 📋 Future Mutations (Neural Backlog)

### [CODON-MAP] Refinement of Reverse Transcription
- **Goal**: Automate the process of identifying "success genes" in the code and moving them to the `REVERSE_TRANSCRIPTION` folder.

### [CODON-UI] Simulation Module
- **Goal**: Implement a energy-saving simulation module using the G-Genome methodology.

## 📔 Lifecycle Status
- **Phase**: SOMATIC_DEVELOPMENT (Prototype is growing)
- **Current IQ**: v1.1 (Standardized with XML Tags)
- **Next Harvest Date**: TBD
