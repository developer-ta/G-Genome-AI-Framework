## 🔬 The Philosophy (As seen on Medium)

The current AI paradigm suffers from **"Cognitive Drift"** : without a rigid structure, large language models tend to hallucinate as context grows. G-GENOME solves this by implementing a digital **Immune System** and a **Génomique Architecture**.

We treat software not as a static set of files, but as a living organism:

1.  **DNA** (`docs/01`) : The immutable laws and protocols.
2.  **Phenotype** (`docs/02`) : The active state, memory, and environment (Substrate).
3.  **Immunity** (`docs/03`) : Continuous audit and auto-signature of tasks.

## 🏗️ 4-Quadrant Architecture (Master Map)

To ensure **0% Cognitive Drift**, every project follows this strict biological partitioning:

| Quadrant                 | Role                         | Bio-Equivalent        |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **01_DNA_CORE**          | Laws, Protocols, Guides      | **Genotype**          |
| **02_PHENOTYPE_RUNTIME** | Intentions, Tasks, Substrate | **Metabolism**        |
| **03_IMMUNE_SYSTEM**     | Validation Scripts, Linter   | **White Blood Cells** |
| **04_MASTER_HERITAGE**   | Releases, Final Deliverables | **Descendants**       |

## 🚀 Orchestrator Dashboard (v1.7)

Our GUI (PyQt6-based) acts as the **Cortex**. It allows humans to provide chaotic intentions and watches as the G-Genome Kernel transforms them into structured, audited code.

**Key Features:**

- **Zero-Friction Entry**: Raw text input metabolized into structured tasks.
- **Immune Monitoring**: Visual risk badges (🟢/🔴) based on the `Governor_Audit_Engine`.
- **Synaptic Bridge**: Real-time polling of project health.
