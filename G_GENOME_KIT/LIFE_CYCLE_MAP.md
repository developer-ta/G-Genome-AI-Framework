# 🧪 G-GENOME : Bio-Digital Engineering Lifecycle
> **Framework Title**: G-Genome v1.0
> **Methodology**: Bio-Inspired Autonomous Context Inheritance

The G-Genome framework treats software as a living organism that evolves through a structured 5-stage lifecycle. This process ensures maximum development velocity and architectural integrity.

## 🏗️ 1. INGÉNIERIE (Preparation)
**Role**: Human Architect
**Action**: The developer prepares the **G-GENOME MASTER KIT**. 
- Selects the appropriate **COGNITIVE_CORE** (The Ancestral DNA).
- populates the **CONTEXT_SUBSTRATE** (The Nutrients: specs, designs, requirements).
- *Result*: A "Fertilized Seed" ready for expansion.

## 🏁 2. PLANTATION (Bootstrap)
**Role**: AI Executor
**Action**: The AI "ingests" the entire Master Kit in one session.
- Follows the `SEED_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md`.
- It becomes an instant "Project Expert" by fusing universal laws (DNA) with specific project needs (Substrate).
- *Result*: Zero-latency project initialization.

## 🌿 3. CROISSANCE (Somatic Development)
**Role**: Hybrid Pair (Human + AI)
**Action**: Building the prototype / Application.
- Tasks are executed as "Evolutionary Steps".
- Every success is logged in the **DEVELOPMENT_EPIGENETICS** layer.
- The "Plant" grows leaves (features) and develops specialized tissues (local solutions).

## 🍎 4. RÉCOLTE (Genetic Harvest)
**Role**: Quality Auditor / Human Architect
**Action**: Extracting the "essence of success" from the finished prototype.
- Identify innovative patterns and robust bug-fixes.
- Use the **REVERSE_TRANSCRIPTION** protocol to isolate high-value genes.

## 🧬 5. RÉGÉNÉRATION (Heredity)
**Role**: System Optimizer
**Action**: Merging the harvested genes back into the Master GENOME for the next generation.
- The `COGNITIVE_CORE` is updated to a new version (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1).
- The next project starts with a higher "Genetic IQ."
