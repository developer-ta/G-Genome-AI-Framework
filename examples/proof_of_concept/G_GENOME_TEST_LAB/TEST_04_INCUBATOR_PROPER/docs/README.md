# 📂 G-GENOME DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM

Welcome to the **Biological Information Storage** of the project. This directory is organized into 4 numbered quadrants to minimize cognitive load and maximize context integrity.

## 🧭 Directory Map

### [01_DNA_CORE](01_DNA_CORE/)
> **The Immutable Laws.**
Contains the `LAWS` (JSON/Rules), `PROTOCOLS` (Workflows), and `GUIDES` for humans. This is the source of truth that never changes during a project cycle.

### [02_PHENOTYPE_RUNTIME](02_PHENOTYPE_RUNTIME/)
> **The Active Metabolism.**
Contains the `Registry_Codon_Tasks.md` (What we are doing now), the `Entry_Metabolism_Inbox.md` (Ideas), and the `CONTEXT_SUBSTRATE` (Project requirements).

### [03_IMMUNE_SYSTEM](03_IMMUNE_SYSTEM/)
> **The Security Layer.**
Python scripts that audit the `02_PHENOTYPE` against the `01_DNA`.

### [04_MASTER_HERITAGE](04_MASTER_HERITAGE/)
> **The Results.**
