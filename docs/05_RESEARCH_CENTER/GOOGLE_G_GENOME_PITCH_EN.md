## 🎯 1. The Bottleneck: The "Amnestic Agent" Problem

Current LLMs suffer from **Context Decay** and **Model Drift** during long-term software engineering tasks. While context windows expand, AI precision collapses during complex "Clean Architecture" execution. We are losing billions in "Cognitive Debt" because agents cannot inherit the refined wisdom of previous проект generations.

## 💡 2. The Solution: G-Genome Industrial (The 4-Cycle Evolutionary Model)

Inspired by biological systems, the **G-Genome** framework treats software development as a generational evolutionary process. We implement a **Supply Chain of Intelligence** through four distinct cycles:

1.  **01_DNA (The Seed)**: Inherited engineering intelligence (Universal laws, Clean Architecture).
2.  **02_BODY (The Active System)**: Local growth and **Intention Metabolism**, where raw human language is "digested" into structured engineering tasks.
3.  **03_VERSIONS (The Harvest)**: Intermediate "snapshots" (v1.2, v1.5) for incremental intelligence preservation.
4.  **04_MASTER_PACK (The Transmission)**: A versioned, traceable "Industrial Unit" ready to bootstrap the next project generation with zero context initialization loss.

## 🚀 3. Core Engine: The Intention Meta-Gateway

G-Genome provides the first functional bridge between raw human intention and industrial-grade execution:
- **Cognitive Synthesizer**: An AI-led process that translates "Non-expert" language into "Industrial Codons" (Tasks).
- **Constitutional Governance**: A mandatory **Plan -> Validation -> Execute** cycle that enforces "SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)" principles on the AI agent.
- **Deterministic Anchoring**: Eliminating probabilistic hallucinations by forcing the AI to validate every action against its own DNA files.

## 📈 4. Strategic Impact for Google

- **Contextual Heritage**: Solving memory decay without retraining. The "Engineering Genetics" of Google improve with every project.
- **Universal Accessibility**: Allowing any Google employee (even non-technical) to direct complex agentic workflows safely.
- **Operational Scalability**: Reducing token waste and "Context Fatigue" by providing agents with a pre-validated "Somatic Memory."

## 🔬 5. Why Me?

My interdisciplinary background in **Medical Sciences** (MSc from China) and **Software Engineering** (BSc France) allows me to view AI agents not as calculators, but as **Digital Organisms**. I am not proposing a simple prompt; I am proposing a **Biological Architecture for Cybernetic Systems**.

**Request**: A technical discussion on scaling **"Bio-Digital Context Engineering"** for future Agentic Workflows at Google Paris.
