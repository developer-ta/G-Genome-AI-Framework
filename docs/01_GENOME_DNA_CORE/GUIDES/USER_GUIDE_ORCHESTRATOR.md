# 📖 G-GENOME ORCHESTRATOR USER GUIDE

Welcome to the **G-GENOME Orchestrator**, your AI Context Engineering environment.
This tool helps you structure, immunize, and manage your software projects by leveraging the G-Genome Framework.

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

### 1. Project Bootstrap (Genesis Mode)
The fastest way to start.
1. Go to **"Project Bootstrap"** in the sidebar.
2. Describe your project idea in plain English (e.g., "A secure Python e-commerce API").
3. Click **"Generate Immunity Prompt"**.
4. Copy the prompt and paste it into your AI Agent (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.).
5. Bring back the generated JSON (DNA) to initialize your project.

### 2. Dna Injector (Expert Mode)
If you already have a `Schema_Genome_Core.json` or want to start from a blank standard template.
1. Go to **"DNA Injector"**.
2. Select your target folder.
3. Click **"Start Injection"**.

## 🧠 CORE CONCEPTS

- **Genome (DNA)**: The immutable laws and rules of your project (`docs/01_GENOME_DNA_CORE`).
- **Phenotype (Runtime)**: The actual code and tasks being executed (`src/`, `docs/02_PHENOTYPE_RUNTIME`).
- **Immune System**: The validation layer that prevents AI hallucinations and code drift.

## ❓ NEED HELP?
Refer to `docs/01_GENOME_DNA_CORE/LAWS/COLLABORATION_GOLDEN_RULES.md` for team collaboration standards.
