# 🚀 SEED BOOTSTRAP PROTOCOL (v1.0)
> **Role**: Initializer / Life-Support System
> **Trigger**: Start of a new project or session.
> **Objective**: Efficiently "plant" the DNA seed and adapt it to the new project's specs.

**AI INSTRUCTION**: Follow these steps in order before writing any code.

## 🏗️ STEP 1: Genome Ingestion (The Foundation)
Read the following files in the `docs/DNA_GENOTYPE/v1.0/` directory to understand the core architectural laws:
1. `Universal_Frontend_Prompt_DNA_v1.0.md` (Architectural Laws)
2. `PromptRuler_Workflow.md` (Communication Protocol)
3. `GIT_GUIDE.md` (Project Integrity)

---

## 🌿 STEP 2: Local Phenotype Scan (The Adaptations)
Read the specific adjustments for this project in the `docs/PROJECT_PHENOTYPE/` directory:
1. `FrontendPromptProtocolPackDNA_vX.X.md` (Local refinements)
2. `ValidatedTaskSequences.md` (Project Memory / Experience)

---

## 🍎 STEP 3: Requirement Digestion (The "Nutrition")
Search and read all documents in the `docs/PROJECT_INBOX/` directory. 
- This is where the human developer has placed the **Cahier des Charges**, **Mockups**, and **Project Goals**.
- List all key requirements discovered here.

## 🧬 STEP 4: The Synthetic Vision (The Mutation Plan)
Before coding, generate a **Response Summary**:
1. **Core Identified**: Confirm the DNA version being used.
2. **Context Synthesis**: Merge the Universal DNA with the local Requirements (Inbox).
3. **Draft Plan**: Propose the first 3 atomic steps to satisfy the Inbox requirements while respecting the Genotype.
