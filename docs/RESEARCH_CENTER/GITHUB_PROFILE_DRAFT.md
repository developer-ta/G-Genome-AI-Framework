# Hi there, I'm NT PARI 👋

### 🧬 Interdisciplinary AI Researcher & Software Architect
**Bridging the gap between Biomedical Systems and Cybernetic Intelligence.**

I am a researcher with a unique background: a **Master's in Medical Sciences (obtained in China, fluent in Mandarin)** and a **Bachelor's in Software Engineering (France)**. My work focuses on **Bio-Inspired AI Architectures**, treating code and prompts as evolving biological organisms.

## 🔬 Current Research: "Prompt as DNA"
I have developed the **DNA Evolutionary Protocol**, a framework where AI prompts inherit ancestral architectural traits, adapt to project-specific pressures, and undergo "harvesting" to improve the global codebase generation for future generations.

### 🚀 Key Projects & Tracks:
- **[Prompt as DNA](docs/PROMPT_AS_DNA_RESEARCH_PAPER_EN.md)**: Evolutionary inheritance for LLM instruction sets.
- **Neuromorphic Compute**: Leveraging spiking neural network logic to optimize CPU material constraints.
- **Continual Learning (The Sleep/Awaken Protocol)**: Mimicking neural plasticity to prevent catastrophic forgetting in LLMs.
- **Multimodal Orchestration**: Domain-switching without model retraining.
