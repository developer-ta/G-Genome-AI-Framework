## 🔬 Track 1: Prompt as DNA (The Evolutionary Protocol)
**Problem**: Context decay and experience loss in AI-assisted development sessions.
**Innovation**: Treats the "Prompt Protocol" as a genetic genome.
*   **Genotype**: The universal architectural standards.
*   **Phenotype**: Local project adaptations.
*   **The Loop**: "Harvesting" successful development patterns from completed projects and "Reverse Transcribing" them into the global master seed.
**Status**: Implementation prototype integrated in current project Repo.

## 🧠 Track 2: Neuromorphic Efficiency (Bypassing Silicon Bottlenecks)
**Problem**: Raw material limitations (Heat, Power, Density) in traditional x86/ARM CPU architectures.
**Innovation**: A neuro-architectural proposal to redesign compute units based on **Neurological Spike-Timing Efficiency**. 
*   **Concept**: Applying neurologically-inspired "gating" mechanisms to the hardware level to minimize energy leakage and maximize throughput without requiring more rare-earth materials.
**Status**: Conceptual Framework (Theoretical Stage).

## 🤖 Track 3: Unified Multimodal Orchestration (Zero-Change Multi-tasking)
**Problem**: The need to retrain or fine-tune models to switch between highly divergent professional domains (Medical, Legal, Technical).
**Innovation**: A dynamic routing framework that allows a single model to manage multiple task profiles without weight modification.
*   **Concept**: Preserving core model stability while utilizing specialized "epigenetic prompt layers" that act as domain-specific filters, enabling high-precision multitasking without retraining costs.
**Status**: Methodology Design.

## 💤 Track 4: The "Sleep/Awaken" Protocol (Continual Learning)
**Problem**: Catastrophic Forgetting—LLMs tend to forget old information when trained on new datasets.
**Innovation**: Mimicking human **Neural Plasticity** and sleep cycles for AI training.
*   **Concept**: A system that "flags" certain neural pathways for "Sleep" (Weight Freezing/Protection) while "Awakening" dormant or redundant nodes for new training sets.
*   **Benefit**: Allows for Lifelong Learning (LLL) where an AI continues to grow its knowledge bank across its entire existence without regressing.
**Status**: Theoretical Abstract.

## 🎯 Goal: Strategic Partnership
As a researcher bridging the gap between **Medicine** and **Computer Science**, my goal is to provide these interdisciplinary frameworks to industry leaders like **Google DeepMind**. I believe that the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) lies not in bigger clusters, but in more **Biologically Efficient Protocols**.
