# 🧬 Universal Prompt DNA (Generic Kernel) v1.0

> **Type**: 🌱 UNIVERSAL SEED (Master Template)
> **Usage Strategy**: COPY this file to your new project's `/docs` folder and rename it to `Project_Name_Prompt_DNA.md`.
> **Role**: The "Genetic Code" for starting high-quality AI-Assisted Projects.

## 🏛️ PART 1: The Immutable Core (Universal Constraints)
*This section contains rules that apply to ANY project to ensure engineering quality.*

### 1.1 The Golden Rules
1.  **Strict Typing**: No `any`. Ever. Define interfaces clearly.
2.  **Atomic Architecture**: Small, single-responsibility files.
3.  **Safety First**: Analyze impact before writing code (The "Think -> Plan -> Execute" loop).
4.  **Protocol-First**: AI must read the local Project DNA before acting.

### 1.2 The Communication Protocol
*   **User Input**: Defined by `PromptRuler` standards (Role/Goal/Constraint/Steps).
*   **AI Output**: Structured Markdown + Code + Validation Checklist.

## 🏗️ PART 2: The Adaptive Layer (Empty Slots)
*This section is the "DNA Slots" waiting to be filled by the specific project. When you instantiate this Seed, these sections grow.*

### 2.1 Technology Stack (Slot)
*(To be defined by specific Project Manifest)*
> [Placeholder]: e.g., React, Vue, Python, Node...

### 2.2 Domain Specifics (Slot)
*(To be defined by specific Project Manifest)*
> [Placeholder]: e.g., Energy Renovation, E-commerce, Finance...

### 2.3 Local Style System (Slot)
*(To be defined by specific Project Manifest)*
> [Placeholder]: e.g., Tailwind, CSS Modules, Material UI...

## 📚 PART 3: The Empty Knowledge Vats (Task Registry)
*Initially empty. This is where the project will store its memories.*

| ID | Task Type | Trigger | Validated Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **INIT-00** | System | "Start Project" | *Seed Planted Successfully.* |
| [EMPTY] | ... | ... | ... |

## 🔄 PART 4: The Reproductive Cycle (Lifecycle Instructions)

### Phase A: Instantiation (Seed -> Plant)
**Instruction**: When starting a new project, copy this file. Fill in **PART 2** with the project's specific tech stack and domain rules.

### Phase B: Evolution (Plant Growth)
**Instruction**: As the Team & AI solve problems, log them in `ValidatedTaskSequences.md`. Periodically updating **PART 3** of the local file.

### Phase C: Harvest (Plant -> New Seed)
**Instruction**: When the project is finished:
1.  Compare the Local `Project_DNA.md` with this `Universal_DNA.md`.
2.  Extract **generic patterns** (e.g., a better way to handle Git conflicts) from the Project.
3.  Merge them back into `Universal_Prompt_DNA_v2.0.md`.
