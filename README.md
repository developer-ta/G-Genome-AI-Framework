## ⚡ 1-MINUTE START
G-Genome provides **Immutability by Design**. It solves the **Amnesia** and **Architectural Drift** of AI Agents by anchoring memory in a disk-based "DNA Registry".

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Launch the Reference Orchestrator (The Reference UX)
python LAUNCH_G_GENOME.py
```

## 🏗️ FRAMEWORK vs ORCHESTRATOR
To avoid confusion for research teams:
1.  **The Framework (Methodology)**: Located in `docs/01_GENOME_DNA_CORE`. It defines the immutable laws (Genotype) and the task registry (Metabolism) that prevent AI cognitive drift.
2.  **The Orchestrator (UX)**: A high-fidelity PyQt6 application that serves as the **Reference Implementation**. It demonstrates how an engineer interacts with the framework to mentor an AI without creating "technical debt".

## 🔬 EMPIRICAL PROOFS (DeepMind Research Grade)
We don't just promise stability; we prove it.
- ✅ **Test #05 (Stress Test)**: Simulation of a critical banking system where AI hallucinations were neutralized (0% drift). [Read Simulation Report](./examples/proof_of_concept/G_GENOME_TEST_LAB/TEST_05_STRESS_IMMUNITY_SIM/SIMULATION_REPORT.md).
- ✅ **6-Month Stability**: Test #00 (React Dashboard) remained 100% compliant after 6 months of iterative development.
