## 🛑 The Fundamental Problem: Context Drift

In modern Software Engineering aided by LLMs, the bottleneck is no longer code generation. It is **Context Consistency**.

As projects grow, AI Agents (and humans) suffer from "Cognitive Drift":
1.  **Amnesia**: Losing track of architectural decisions made 10 commits ago.
2.  **Hallucination**: Inventing new patterns that violate existing rules.
3.  **Entropy**: The codebase becomes a chaotic mix of conflicting styles.

**Prompts are not enough.** You cannot prompt-engineer your way out of architectural entropy. You need a **Governance System**.

## 🧬 The G-Genome Solution

G-Genome is not a library. It is a **System of Laws** anchored in the file system, designed to force **Homeostasis** (stability) onto the development process.

### The Biological Metaphor
Instead of rigid templates, we use a biological lifecycle:
*   **Genotype (DNA)**: Immutable laws stored in `docs/01_GENOME_DNA_CORE`. (The Code *must* obey these).
*   **Phenotype (Runtime)**: The actual code produced.
*   **Immune System (Governor)**: An audit engine that rejects code violating the DNA.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience
This framework is designed for:
*   **AI Safety & Alignment Researchers**: Studying how to constrain generative models within safe boundaries.
*   **R&D Engineering Teams**: Building autonomous agent workflows that need to scale beyond "demos".
*   **Enterprise Architects**: Seeking a standard for Human-AI collaboration.

### ❌ What G-Genome is NOT
*   It is **NOT** a Chatbot or a VS Code Extension.
*   It is **NOT** a prompt library.
*   It is **NOT** a "No-Code" tool.
*   It is **NOT** a commercial SaaS product.

## 🔓 Open Source vs. Sovereign Core

This repository serves as a **Public Architectural Preview**.

| Feature | Open Source (This Repo) | Sovereign Edition (Private) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **DNA File Structure** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Orchestrator UX (PyQt)** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Integration Protocols** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Governor Engine** | ⚠️ *Simulation Stub* | ✅ **Full Neural Logic** |
| **Risk Assessment Matrix** | ❌ Manual | ✅ **Autonomous** |
| **Self-Healing Homeostasis** | ❌ Disabled | ✅ **Active** |

> **Why is the Core Private?**
> The **Sovereign Governor Engine** allows for autonomous code modification and self-repair. In alignment with **AI Safety principles**, we strictly sandbox this capability to prevent uncontrolled agentic behavior in the wild.

## 🛠️ Exploring the Architecture (Quick Start)

Researchers and Engineers can audit the **Structural Skeleton** immediately:

```bash
# 1. Clone the Architecture
git clone https://github.com/developer-ta/G-Genome-AI-Framework.git

# 2. View the DNA Laws (The "Constitution")
cat docs/01_GENOME_DNA_CORE/LAWS/Schema_Genome_Core.json

# 3. Launch the Reference Orchestrator
pip install PyQt6
python LAUNCH_G_GENOME.py
```

*See [QUICKSTART_GOOGLE.md](QUICKSTART_GOOGLE.md) for a detailed technical walkthrough.*

## 🤝 Collaboration & Contact

**G-Genome** is an intellectual artifact developed to solve the "Last Mile" of AI Engineering.

I am open to discussions regarding:
*   **Research Collaboration** (AI Governance, Context Engineering).
*   **Architectural Integration** for Enterprise ecosystems.
